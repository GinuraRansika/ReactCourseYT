    ! Why React ?
        ? It's Composable Code

    * We can take codes for a navbar and put it into our own custom components
    * and we can put those components together to make something Larger
        eg: <body>
                <MyAwesomeNavBar/>
                <MainContent/>
                <MyAwesomeFooter/>
            </body>

            ? because of that our code becomes more maintainable and flexible
